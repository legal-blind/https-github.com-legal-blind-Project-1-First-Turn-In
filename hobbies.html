        <h2>Step-by-Step: The One-Loop (Standard Bow) Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cross the laces over each other to form an "X."</li>
            <li>Take the bottom lace and pull it through the loop at the top of the "X."</li>
            <li>Pull both ends tightly to secure the knot.</li>
            <li>Create a small loop (bunny ear) with one lace.</li>
            <li>Wrap the other lace around the base of the bunny ear.</li>
            <li>Push the wrapping lace through the hole created during the wrap.</li>
            <li>Pull on both loops (bunny ears) to tighten the bow.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Step-by-Step: The Two-Loop (Double Bunny Ears) Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by crossing the laces in an "X," pulling the bottom lace through the loop and tightening it as before.</li>
            <li>Make a small loop (bunny ear) with each lace separately.</li>
            <li>Cross the two bunny ears over each other to form an "X."</li>
            <li>Pull one bunny ear through the loop at the bottom of the "X."</li>
            <li>Tighten the bow by pulling both loops outward.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Extra Tip</h2>
        <p>For added security, tie the two loops together with an additional knot. This can be helpful during sports or other activities where your shoes need to stay firmly tied.</p>
